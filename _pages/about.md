I am a final-year Computer Science undergrad at Bellini College of AI, Cybersecurity and Computing, University of South Florida (USF). My research interest is broadly under *Representation Learning*, *Multimodal Learning*, *Ubiquitous Computing*, and *Computational Precision Medicine/Healthcare* (specifically *Medical Imaging* and *Auditing Framework*).


I am also a research assistant @ USF advised by Profs. Lawrence Hall, Dmitry Goldgof, and Yu Sun, and research trainee @ Moffitt Cancer Center supervised by Naveena Gorre and Dr. Issam El Naqa.
